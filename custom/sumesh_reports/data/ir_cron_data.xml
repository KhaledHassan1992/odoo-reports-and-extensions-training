When declaring a record in XML:

    - Place id attribute before model

    - For field declarations, the name attribute is first. Then place the value either in the field tag, either in the
    eval attribute, and finally other attributes (widget, options, ...) ordered by importance.

    - Try to group the records by model. In case of dependencies between action/menu/views, the convention may not be
    applicable.

    - Do not prefix the xmlid by the current module's name
    (<record id="view_id"..., not <record id="current_module.view_id"...)

    // // //

    Use the following pattern, where <model_name> is the name of the model
    that the record is an instance of: <model_name>_<record_name>

        <record id="res_users_important_person" model="res.users">
            ...
        </record>

-->


<odoo>
    <data>

        <record id="model_name_my_record" model="model.name">
            <!-- My record data -->
        </record>

    </data>
</odoo>
